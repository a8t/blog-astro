Hello. I'm Andy Tran. I use [they/them pronouns](/2019/05/21/pronouns).

I am Vietnamese, born and raised near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. My parents arrived here in Canada in the 80s.

I went to university to study physics. I decided quickly that I would not like to be a physicist. After I graduated, I followed a path that I didn't really expect I'd take, which was to follow my father's footsteps and pursue software development.

Since 2017, I have worked at a few small companies as a full-stack software developer. I've learned a lot about both handling technical projects and working with software teams. I've managed databases, built mobile apps, maintained REST and GraphQL APIs, and more.
