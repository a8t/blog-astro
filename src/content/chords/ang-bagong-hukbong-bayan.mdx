# Intro

The New People's Army is the armed mass organization led by the Communist Party of the Philippines. This is its anthem.

The NPA was founded on March 29, 1969, and has been waging a protracted people's war against the US-backed Philippine state since then.

To understand more about the NPA, you can check out this video.
